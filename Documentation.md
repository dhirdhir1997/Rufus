## How Rufus Works
Rufus works by following a three-step process to extract, filter, and process information:
- **Web Scraping**: Rufus uses libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup to make HTTP requests to websites and parse their HTML content. It can also use Selenium to handle pages that require JavaScript rendering.
- **Content Filtering**: Once content is extracted, Rufus uses NLP techniques powered by Spacy and KeyBERT to filter out irrelevant content. It performs keyword extraction from user instructions and matches those keywords with web content to identify relevant sections.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Rufus integrates pre-trained transformer models (like those from sentence-transformers) to perform similarity scoring between user instructions and the text extracted from web pages. This helps identify the most relevant content based on semantic similarity.
- **Data Export**: The scraped data is structured and saved in a JSON format. This makes it easy to consume the data for further processing, including use in machine learning models or other pipelines.

## Integrating Rufus into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is designed to retrieve relevant documents from a corpus and use those documents to augment text generation, typically with a model like GPT. Rufus can be integrated into a RAG pipeline as the retriever.

- **Retrieval**: Rufus can be used to scrape web content and retrieve the relevant information based on user queries. This information is filtered and passed as context to a generation model
- **Augmentation**: After the relevant content is retrieved, a model like GPT-3 or a T5-based model can be used to generate text based on the context provided by Rufus. For example:
  ```bash
  from transformers import pipeline


  client = RufusClient()
  documents = client.scrape("https://www.ncsu.edu", "Give me details about the campus facilities.")


  context = " ".join([doc['content'] for doc in documents])


  generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt-3")
  generated_text = generator(f"Using the following context: {context}", max_length=150)

  print(generated_text)
  ```
